Pre-requisite:
	Please make sure maven is installed in your system for the build 
	script to run

	We are using jdk 7 to compile the jar, please make sure your machine 
	is pointing to a jdk 7 installation

	Please make sure that complete latex package is installed to ensure that 
	the rmd script to create the report runs smoothly without any problems

	If you run into permission issues for build, please run the command 
	with sudo. 

	Make sure that aws is configured, as the script uses aws commands to 
	download the output files and create a cluster

Before running the code:
	Please edit the makefile to configure the required parameters
	BUCKET = this will be the name of the bucket you choose
	REGION = the region in which you wish to provision your cluster
	KEY_NAME = name of the EC2 key that you generated for that region
	SPARK_PATH = path of your spark installation
	INPUT = path of input in you local system

	For the KEY_NAME - create a EC2 key pair for the region in which you wish
  		      	    to provision the cluster and put the name of that key 
		            as the value to this argument
	
	Tutorial for creating an EC2 key pair
	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair

To run the program on aws:
	-build the jar(make build)
	-create the bucket(make setupCloud)
	-upload the jar(make upload)
	-run the program and download the output(make run)
	-generate the report(make report)

To run the program locally
	-build the jar(make build)
	-run the program(make pseudo)

Flow: 
	make build -> make setupCloud -> make upload -> make run -> make report
	make build -> make pseudo
