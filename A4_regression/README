pre-requisite:
-Please make sure maven is installed in your system for the build script to run
-We are using jdk 7 to compile the jar, please make sure your machine is pointing to a jdk 7 installation
-please make sure that complete latex package is installed to ensure that the rmd script to create the report runs smoothly without any problems
-If you run into permission issues for build, please run the command with sudo.
-Make sure that aws is configured, as the script uses aws commands to download the output files

rpackages to be installed:
ggplot
rmarkdown

before running the code:
-please edit the Makefile to change the input 
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = will have the value for you aws key
AWS_ACCESS_ID = Please put you aws id here
INPUT = it points to s3://mrclassvitek/data. If you want to change the path please change it to the bucket you choose with the input path
BUCKET = this will be the name of the bucket you choose

-*Do not change the output folder names as these are used by the rscript

-We have used Prof. Jan Vitek's uber-perf-0.0.1 jar to run the code. So please make sure to place the jar in the source folder and  configured in your system with the appropriate key name and other required parameters.

To run the program:
	-setup all parameters like keys and perf file for the uber-perf-0.0.1 jar
	-build the jar
	-upload the jar to s3
	-run the program

compiling:
----------
make build

upload:
-------
make upload
this will upload the job.jar created after build step to the bucket you have chosen

running:
--------
make run

This will run the jobs sequentially, 1st with time=1 and then the time=200 job
Note: Each job takes ~1hr to run, please leave the command to run for the time period, after both jobs have been executed, the output files are downloaded automatically, and the graph will be created.

if you want to run the jobs in parallel you can use the following commands in seperate terminals

make runn1
make runn200

You will have to check and see if both the jobs have finished executing, after which you can run 'make graph' to get the report
