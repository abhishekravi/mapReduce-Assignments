Pre-requisite:
	Please make sure maven is installed in your system for the build 
	script to run

	We are using jdk 7 to compile the jar, please make sure your machine 
	is pointing to a jdk 7 installation

	Please make sure that complete latex package is installed to ensure that 
	the rmd script to create the report runs smoothly without any problems

	If you run into permission issues for build, please run the command 
	with sudo. 

	Make sure that aws is configured, as the script uses aws commands to 
	download the output files

Before running the code:
	Please edit the makefile to add the bucket name
	BUCKET = this will be the name of the bucket you choose

To run the program:
	-build the jar(make build)
	-upload the jar to s3 and sync required files (make setupCloud)
	-run the program(make run)
	-download and validate the output after job run is complete (make validate)
	-generate the report(make report)

Flow: 
	make build -> make setupCloud -> make run -> make validate -> make report
