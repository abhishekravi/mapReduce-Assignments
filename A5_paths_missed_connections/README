pre-requisite:
Please make sure maven is installed in your system for the build script to run
We are using jdk 7 to compile the jar, please make sure your machine is pointing to a jdk 7 installation
please make sure that complete latex package is installed to ensure that the rmd script to create the report runs smoothly without any problems
If you run into permission issues for build, please run the command with sudo.
make sure that aws is configured, as the script uses aws commands to download the output files

We have used professor's uber-perf-0.0.1 jar to run our program. So please make sure that the jar is setup and can be used

INPUT = this is the input folder in s3 having the data
PINPUT = this is the input folder in local
OUTPUT = this will be the output folder
BUCKET = this will be the name of the bucket you choose


To run the program:
