pre-requisite:
-------------
Please make sure maven is installed in your system for the build script to run
We are using jdk 7 to compile the jar, please make sure your machine is pointing to a jdk 7 installation
please make sure that complete latex package is installed to ensure that the rmd script to create the report runs smoothly without any problems
If you run into permission issues for build, please run the command with sudo.
make sure that aws is configured, as the script uses aws commands to download the output files
please download the validate file 98validate.csv.gz to you local storage and extract the csv file.

before running the code:
-----------------------
please edit the makefile to change the input and output directories
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = will have the value for you aws key
AWS_ACCESS_ID = Please put you aws id here
HINPUT = this is the folder where the historical data exists
TINPUT = this is the folder where the historical data exists
OUTPUT = output folder name
BUCKET = s3 bucket name
VPATH = local path of where the 98validate.csv file is
FSPATH = hadoop root path
LOGPATH = logs folder name in s3

We have used Prof. Jan Vitek's uber-perf-0.0.1 jar to run the code. So please make sure to place the jar in the source folder and  configured in your system with the appropriate key name and other required parameters.
This will ensure the whole running process is automated

If not you can still use make cloud, but you will manually have to run make report after the job terminates

To run the program:
	-setup all parameters like keys and perf file for the uber-perf-0.0.1 jar
	-build the jar
	-upload the jar to s3
	-run the program

compiling:
----------
make build

setup
-----
make setup
this will upload the job.jar created after build step to the bucket you have chose and do all cleanup

run:
-------
make run
this will automatically generate the report after the job terminates in aws


running manually:
--------
make cloud
make report

This will run the job in aws, but you will have to run make report once the job is done

Package content:
The pakcage contains the following:
A6.pdf - report generated
perf.txt - used by uber-perf-0.0.1.jar, please edit it to the settings of you machine and AWS cluster
pom.xml - maven build script
results.csv - output file containing performance data
Makefile - has commands to compile and run the code
A6.Rmd - rscript to create the report
A6.java - main driver class for the hadoop program
AWSHelperClass.java - helper class used by the program to upload and download files from and to s3
BadDataException.java - custom exception class
